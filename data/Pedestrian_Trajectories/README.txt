Corridor data are trajectories of pedestrians in a closed corridor of lenght 30m and width 1.8m. 
The trajectories are measured on a section of length 6m. 
Experiments are carried out with N=15, 30, 60, 85, 95, 110, 140 and 230 participants. 

Bottleneck data are trajectories of pedestrian in a bottleneck of lenght 8m and width 1.8m. 
Experiments are carried out with 150 participants for bottleneck widths w=0.7, 0.95 1.2 and 1.8m.
