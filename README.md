### Description
This project contains an analysis of the paper [_Prediction of Pedestrian Speed with Artificial Neural Networks_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09782.pdf), Tordeux et al., 2018.
We tried to replicate their results, as well as to test the approach on new scenarios created with the software [Vadere](https://www.vadere.org/).
Finally we discussed weak points of the paper as well as possible solutions/improvements and future developments.<br>
Refer to the [report](report/report.pdf) for a more detailed description of the work as well as for understanding the organization of the code.
